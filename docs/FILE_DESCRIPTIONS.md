# Project File Descriptions

This document provides a brief overview of the purpose and functionality of each file within the **backend**, **database**, and **src** directories of the **Stock Exchange Prediction Tool**.

## **Backend Directory**

### 1. `server.py`
- **Purpose:** Initializes and runs the backend server using a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django). Handles incoming API requests and routes them to the appropriate controllers.

### 2. `config.py`
- **Purpose:** Stores configuration settings such as API keys, database connection strings, and environment variables. Centralizes configuration to simplify management and enhance security.

### 3. `models.py`
- **Purpose:** Defines the data models representing the structure of the data used in the application. Includes classes for entities like `Stock`, `User`, and `Prediction`.

### 4. `controllers.py`
- **Purpose:** Contains the logic for handling API requests. Processes incoming data, interacts with the database, and returns responses to the client.

### 5. `requirements.txt`
- **Purpose:** Lists all Python dependencies required to run the backend server. Ensures that all necessary packages are installed for consistent environment setup.

## **Database Directory**

### 1. `schema.sql`
- **Purpose:** Defines the database schema, including tables, columns, data types, and relationships. Used to set up the initial database structure.

### 2. `init_db.py`
- **Purpose:** Initializes the database by executing the SQL schema. Seeds the database with initial data if necessary.

### 3. `database.py`
- **Purpose:** Manages the connection to the database. Provides functions to execute queries, retrieve data, and handle transactions.

## **Src Directory**

### 1. `main.py`
- **Purpose:** Serves as the entry point for the application. Orchestrates the workflow by coordinating data fetching, processing, and prediction tasks.

### 2. `data_fetcher.py`
- **Purpose:** Handles data retrieval from external sources, such as the Alpha Vantage API. Fetches real-time and historical stock data for analysis.

### 3. `analysis.py`
- **Purpose:** Performs data analysis and preprocessing. Cleans data, engineers features, and prepares datasets for predictive modeling.

### 4. `prediction_model.py`
- **Purpose:** Implements machine learning algorithms used to forecast stock prices. Includes functions for training, validating, and making predictions.

### 5. `utils.py`
- **Purpose:** Provides utility functions that support various parts of the application. Includes helpers for logging, error handling, and data transformation.

### 6. `requirements.txt`
- **Purpose:** Lists all Python dependencies required for the source components. Ensures that all necessary packages are installed for consistent environment setup.

## **Additional Files**

### 1. `.gitignore`
- **Purpose:** Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore. Prevents sensitive information, build artifacts, and unnecessary files from being tracked.

### 2. `README.md`
- **Purpose:** Provides an overview of the project, including setup instructions, usage guidelines, and contribution information. Serves as the primary documentation for users and contributors.
