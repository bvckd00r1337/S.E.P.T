4. **User Personalization**
   - Customizable risk tolerance settings.
   - Watchlists for specific stocks or sectors.
   - Alerts for key market events or prediction changes.

5. **Backtesting and Simulation**
   - Historical data analysis for user strategies.
   - Simulated trades to evaluate AI predictions.

6. **Explainable AI**
   - Visual explanations for AI predictions (e.g., charts, sentiment breakdown).
   - Confidence levels for each prediction.

7. **User Interface**
   - Simple dashboard with:
     - Real-time stock trends.
     - Sentiment heatmaps.
     - Predicted price movements.
   - Mobile and desktop compatibility.

2. **Frontend**
   - Frameworks: React.js or Vue.js.
   - Data Visualization: D3.js or Chart.js.

3. **Database**
   - Storage: PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for unstructured data.
   - Real-time processing: Apache Kafka or Redis Streams.

4. **Cloud Infrastructure**
   - Compute: AWS, GCP, or Azure.
   - GPU/TPU for model training and inference.

5. **APIs**

   - Social media: Twitter API, Reddit API.
   - News: Google News API, web scraping tools like BeautifulSoup.

## **Security and Compliance**
1. **Data Security**
   - SSL/TLS for all data transmissions.
   - Regular vulnerability scans.

2. **Compliance**
   - Follow regulations (e.g., GDPR, SEC guidelines).
   - Ensure transparency in AI predictions.

## **Initial MVP**
